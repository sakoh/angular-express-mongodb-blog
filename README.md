# Angular Express Seed Example App

Based on the Ryan Ford's [Angular Express Seed](https://github.com/btford/angular-express-seed), I translated the app.js and routes/api.js files to Coffeescript, hooked up the backend to MongoDB for persistant data and added in Twitter Bootstrap for some styling.
